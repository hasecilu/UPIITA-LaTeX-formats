% 0.3 Acta

% There is a LaTeX package for tesis called: tesisupiita
% created by professor Dr. Juan Carlos Guzmán Salgado

% Template using this package: https://github.com/CuetoA/Plantilla-Tesis

% The problem with that package is:
% Predefined style, hard to tweak
% Uses high level commands, hard to understand how those commands works
% Hides low level commands

% Anyway, the cover looks so nice, I created a .sty file derivated from the original tesisupiita style file and only left commands for "portada" and "acta", this way any configuration from the original packages will NOT affect my configuration
