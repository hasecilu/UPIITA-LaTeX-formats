% 0.2 Portada

% First proposal, mmmmm
\include{parts/0_pre/0.2.1_portada_v1}	% NOT RECOMMENDED (comment this line)

% Second proposal, mmmm, only works for 1 person
\include{parts/0_pre/0.2.1_portada_v2}	% NOT RECOMMENDED (comment this line)

% Third proposal, original made by: 
	% tesisupiita Tesis: UPIITA-IPN
	% Copyright (C) 2008 Juan Carlos Guzmán Salgado
	
% There is a LaTeX package for tesis called: tesisupiita
% created by professor Dr. Juan Carlos Guzmán Salgado

% Template using this package: https://github.com/CuetoA/Plantilla-Tesis

% The problem with that package is:
	% Predefined style, hard to tweak
	% Uses high level commands, hard to understand how those commands works
	% Hides low level commands

% Anyway, the cover looks so nice, I created a .sty file derivated from the original tesisupiita style file and only left commands for "portada" and "acta", this way any configuration from the original packages will NOT affect MY configuration

\include{parts/0_pre/0.2.2_portada_v3}	% RECOMMENDED
